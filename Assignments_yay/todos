MH-8 Q-Learning
- How to format the output of the state-values, now it's giving these 'e's T_____T
- While loop instead of for loop: need convergence criterium
- cumulative rewards counter

Ask
(1) the range of different alphas and different epsilons we should try for the different algos
(2) How to evaluate the algorithms? ''Typically planning and reinforcement learning algorithms are 
evaluated in terms of quality (e.g., accumulated rewards, error with respect to the 
optimal policy, regret, etc.) as a function of runtime.''
- Based on answers to these questions, adjust Main.py etc.
